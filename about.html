            	<p style="color:white">Welcome to Houston’s Best Pet Sitters. We provide care and comfort to pets when their owners are away, which means peace of mind for you as a pet parent. That’s right — you and your pets are a part of our family. While we care for your pets, we care for you, too. And that’s been our mission from the very beginning.</p>

			<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
		<p>More than twelve years ago, Houston’s Best Pet Sitters was founded to bring the highest level of pet care to furry family members in the Houston area. It’s been an incredible experience, and with the help of our fantastic team of pet sitters and dog walkers, we have cared for thousands of cats and dogs over the years. We are a local, family-owned business that understands how stressful it can be to leave your pets alone when you are away from home.

		Cara-Lisa Leatherman, the owner of Houston’s Best Pet Sitters, has been around pets her entire life. Growing up in a home filled with rescue, foster, and adopted animals triggered a love and passion for pets that have never stopped. Cara-Lisa, and her husband, Brad, have had many pets over the years, and their current family includes three dogs, Jax, Leila, and Tank, in addition to their six kids. They live in Tomball and, when not working, can be found at local baseball fields, football fields, choir concerts, or out enjoying all that the Houston area has to offer.</p>
